## Deploy &amp; Extend Portfolio

I create and deploy a server on Heroku containing a modified version on my Gallery of Horns app which was created in a previous lab collaboratively with Wondwosen Tsige. The app has been modified to play a sound and display a modal when a displayed image card is clicked on.
